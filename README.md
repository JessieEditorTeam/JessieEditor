# JessieEditor
We created a fully customizable IDE, that was designed with students education in mind. It is fully equipped with basic commands for high level languages, to help them start off writing programs. The program can also be fully expanded by adding a wide variety of plugins, or customizing the build output to fit their application.
We have integrated our program to be classroom friendly by allowing students to earn “points” for successfully writing a program.  These points can be used in the plugin store to purchase plugins to expand the student’s programming capability. The plugin store is operated by a repository system, which allows students to add up to 10 repositories to choose the plugin of their choice in return for their points earned.
In the programming IDE, there is a toolbar containing all the commands to get the students started. Whenever a user clicks one of the commands, a form or dialog will prompt the user to enter specific values, and then add the finished command to the main code document. This allows the user to see how their input created the output code. Using this principle the user will eventually learn how to type the code in the editor on their own, without using the forms.
The programs written can be compiled to the directory of the user’s choice or it can be debugged from within the IDE’s root directory. The user can then debug errors from within the editor. Users can also create a  compiled, and runnable program, in the user’s save directory.
