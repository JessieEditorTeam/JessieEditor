<body><h1 style="text-decoration: underline;">Custom Commands</h1>Since Jessie Editor vanilla commands are for creating batch files, Jessie Editor also comes with five custom commands.<br>These custom commands allow users to input any command they want to make Jessie Editor friendly with any language.<br>To add a custom command you can either click on one of the custom commands in the commands bar or goto the properties<br>menu and select custom commands. Once you get there the custom commands form will appear.<br><img style="width: 706px; height: 686px;" alt="" src="Images/customcommandspic1.png"><br>To add a custom command, click in one of the command name textboxes and give your command a name. For this demo,<br>we will name it tutorial. Then give your command the actual code. In the command textbox add the code you want to be <br>added whenever your command is clicked. We will use "echo You did it!". To add your command, click the submit button<br>and it will be added to the sidebar. To run your command, click it in the sidebar again and the command will be added to<br>the main editor's code.<br><a href="index.html"><br>back</a></body></html>
